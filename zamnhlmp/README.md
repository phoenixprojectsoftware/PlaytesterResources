    Select **Clone a repository from the Internet...**
 4. On this screen, search `zamnhlmp` and you should see this:

	  Select the **phoenixprojectsoftware/zamnhlmp** repository.
4. Now, in the **Local path** box, enter where you have *Half-Life* installed. For most people it's `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life`. If you are unsure where you have *Half-Life* installed, consult the lead developer in the Phoenix Discord.
5. Click the **Clone** button and wait for the game to download.
6. Once it has finished downloading, restart Steam. You should see ***Half-Life: Zombies Ate My Neighbours Multiplayer*** in your library.
### How to update
1. Open the `zamnhlmp` repository on GitHub Desktop. It should look like this:

2. Select the **Repository** tab on the top and click **Pull.**

## Traditional download (worst method)
1. Go to the [*Half-Life: Zombies Ate My Neighbours Multiplayer* developer repository.](https://github.com/phoenixprojectsoftware/zamnhlmp) If you do not have access to it, let the lead developer know in the Phoenix Discord.
2. Scroll down until you see **Releases** on the right hand side. Click the **Releases** link to find all the compiled builds of ZAMNHL.

3. Find the latest release with the tag **"pre-release."** It should display at the top. Do NOT download a version with the tag **"Latest release."**
4. Click the **Assets** button to expand its section. Then select **Source code (zip).** This will download the game in a ZIP file. When you open it after it downloads, it will have a folder called `zamnhlmp-VERSIONNUMBER` (obviously it won't say "VERSIONNUMBER," but the version you downloaded).
5. Rename the folder from `zamnhlmp-VERSIONNUMBER` to just `zamnhlmp` in the ZIP file.
6. Keep the ZIP open. Go into Steam, and find *Half-Life* in your library on the sidebar (if you do not own *Half-Life* on Steam, you will not be able to play ZAMNHLMP. [Buy *Half-Life* here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70) if you don't own it). Right click it and select **Manage** and then go to **Browse local files.**
7. Drag and drop the `zamnhlmp` folder from the ZIP into the ***Half-Life* folder** and it should extract. When performing the drag & drop procedure, make sure that another folder or file is not highlighted.
8. Restart Steam and you should see ***Half-Life: Zombies Ate My Neighbours Multiplayer*** in your library. If you can't find it, try searching for it. If you still can't find it, you may have extracted the game incorrectly. Check with #playtesters-general in the Phoenix Discord and try the process again.
9. Run the game.
### How to update
Open the link provided to you in #playtesters-announcements and follow the download instructions above from step 4. When updating your install from the Traditional Method, always delete your existing installing first before updating. This is why we recommend using GitHub Desktop or Git, because when we delete or add new files, you don't have to delete your existing installation.
