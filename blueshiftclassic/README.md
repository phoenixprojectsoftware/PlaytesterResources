# How to Install Blue Shift Classic
## Downloading GitHub Desktop
Though you can just use a CLI, GitHub Desktop is the easiest way to install and update this mod. To install GitHub Desktop, [click here.](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
## Installing *Half-Life* on Steam
Open your Steam library and [install *Half-Life.*](steam://install/70) Ensure the game is not set to the `steam_legacy` branch. Once the game is installed, right-click it in your library menu and go to **Manage > Browse Local Files.**

This will open a File Explorer window to your local *Half-Life* install directory:

Click the blank space in the file-path to the left of the search box, and the space will become typeable. Copy the path to your clipboard; in most cases it's `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life`.

## Cloning ZAMNHLMP
Now, you can clone ZAMNHLMP from The Phoenix Project Software. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your account.

On the intro screen, click "clone a repository from the Internet" and go to the URL tab to enter the following in the URL box:

`phoenixprojectsoftware/blueshiftclassic`

And in the **Local path** box, paste your *Half-Life* install directory and add to the end of it `blueshiftclassic`, so it SHOULD look [something] like this:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\blueshiftclassic\`

If it's all correct click **Clone** and wait for the process to finish.

## Opening the game
Restart Steam by going to the icon in the system tray and clicking Exit, or the top left Steam dropdown box in the main window. Once restarted, you should see ***Phoenix Developer - Half-Life: Zombies Ate My Neighbours Multiplayer*** in your library. Open it, and you should see the game's main menu screen. ZAMNHLMP Dev is now installed.

# Updating the game
At the very top of the GitHub Desktop Window, go to **Repository > Pull** to download the latest changes. The process shouldn't take too long.
