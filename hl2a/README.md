# How to Install
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Source SDK Base 2013** installed on Steam. To do this, go to your library, search "Source SDK" and install **Source SDK Base 2013.** Once it's finished, right click it, go to PROPERTIES, BETAS, then set the branch from `None` to `upcoming - upcoming`.
### Traditional download (easiest method)
1. Go to the [*Half-Life 2 Anniversary* developer repository.](https://github.com/phoenixprojectsoftware/hl2a) If you do not have access to it, let the lead developer know in the Phoenix Discord.
2. Click the green "Code" button with the download icon next to it, and click on Download ZIP. The latest version of the game [at the time] will start downloading as a ZIP file.
3. Rename the folder from `hl2a-master` to just `hl2a` in the ZIP file.
5. Go to where you have Steam installed. This is usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\`. If you're on a 32-bit computer, it'll be in the `Program Files` folder instead. Go to the steamapps folder, then the sourcemods folder. If there isn't one, check you have **Source SDK Base 2013** installed. Or, create the folder. Drag and drop the hl2a folder from the ZIP into the sourcemods folder.
6. Restart Steam and you should see ***Lupin Bean*** in your library. If you can't find it, try searching for it. If you still can't find it, you may have extracted the game incorrectly. Check with #playtesters-general in the Phoenix Discord and try the process again.
7. Run the game. Play it, and send feedback (use the template in Pinned Messages) to `#playtesters-feedback` - the engine we use for this game is `Source 2013`
